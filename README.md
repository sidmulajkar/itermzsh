# Many people have asked me regarding how to set up my terminal for better productivity using iterm and zsh

Follow the configure-terminal.sh file with commands for installing those with the powerlevel9k theme and advanced code completion, search history, syntax highlighting, etc.

### Instructions:

1.  Once everything is done with the commands close the terminal and open the iterm, for the first time you need to allow from system preferences to run it.

2.  From the menu open the iterm preferences, select the profile tab, open the text section, select the font dropdown option and type sourcecoderpro and select the option.

3.  In the Color tab next to the text, click on the color presets option and select the import option and look for the file saved on the desktop with "shades-of-blue.itermcolors" and again select the option from the dropdown after importing the color scheme.

4.  For the font to take the effect close and reopen the iterm and it works!
